            <h1>Welcome to Fuber -- a company for foodies, by foodies. Everybody enjoys restaurant-quality food, but getting out in big cities can be a hassle -- looking for parking, splitting the bill with friends later, and even ordering one or two alcoholic drinks can be incredibly expensive. This company was founded by Diana Lin, who after years of living in San Francisco and traveling through major cities, decided to bring restaurant quality food to you! You can still wear your pajamas, drink a nice wine, and not once have to worry about finding parking or dealing with Uber surge prices. Come get to know our five chefs! 
                
            We are currently only testing in San Francisco, California, but hoping to expand. Please reach out if you're interested in working with us in a new city! </h1>
