# Phase 4 Full-Stack Application Project 
Diana Lin

## Introduction
Getting around major cities can be inconvenient, and going out for dinner can be incredibly expensive if you’re drinking with a large group! I’ve created a website (currently beta for San Francisco only) where you can hire personal chefs who live within 5 miles of you for your special event -- all you need to do is pay for their time and for the ingredients. How's a Friday night eating restaurant quality food without having to take an uber and waiting to be seated? This members-only app features five chefs and a page of the dishes they'll be serving for you. 

Please see video demo here: 

This website was created using a React front end along with a Flask backend that utilizes SQLAlchemy for the databases.

## How to access site 
cd server (Flask backend)
pipenv install
python app.py

cd ..
cd client (React frontend)
npm install
npm start
