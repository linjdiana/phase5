# Phase 4 Full-Stack Application Project 
Diana Lin

## Introduction

Getting around major cities can be inconvenient, and going out for dinner can be incredibly expensive if you’re drinking with a large group! I’ve created a website (currently beta for San Francisco only) where you can hire personal chefs who live within 5 miles of you for your special event -- all you need to do is pay for their time and for the ingredients. How's a Friday night eating restaurant quality food without having to take an uber and waiting to be seated? This members-only app also has some special recipes that you can try at home.
